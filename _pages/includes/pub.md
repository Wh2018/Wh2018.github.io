[Cascade Context-oriented Spatio-temporal Attention Network for Efficient and Fine-grained Video-grounded Dialogue](https://journal.hep.com.cn/fcs/EN/10.1007/s11704-024-40387-w) \\

- Video-Grounded Dialogue System (VGDS), focusing on generating reasonable responses based on multi-turn dialogue contexts and a given video, has received intensive attention recently. We propose a novel system, namely Cascade cOntext-oriented Spatial-Temporal Attention Network (COSTA), to generate reasonable responses efficiently and accurately.

[Memory-enhanced Emotional Support Conversations with Motivation-driven Strategy Inference](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-70362-1_13) \\
**Hao Wang**, Bin Guo, Mengqi Chen, Yasan Ding, Qiuyun Zhang, Ying Zhang, Zhiwen Yu

- The prevalence of mental disorders is increasing globally, highlighting the need for effective emotional support systems. Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) systems have emerged as a promising solution, providing supportive responses to individuals experiencing emotional distress. we propose MAGIC, a Memory-enhanced emotional support conversation system with motivation-driven strAteGy InferenCe.

[The Future of Cognitive Strategy-enhanced Persuasive Dialogue Agents: New Perspectives and Trends](https://journal.hep.com.cn/fcs/EN/10.1007/s11704-024-40057-x) \\ 

Mengqi Chen, Bin Guo, **Hao Wang**, Haoyu Li, Qian Zhao, Jingqi Liu, Yasan Ding, Yan Pan, Zhiwen Yu

- Persuasion, as one of the crucial abilities in human communication, has garnered extensive attention from researchers within the field of intelligent dialogue systems. The cognitive strategy-enhanced persuasive dialogue agent (defined as CogAgent), which incorporates cognitive strategies to achieve persuasive targets through conversation, has become a predominant research paradigm. We make a comprehensive survey of CogAgent.

[Towards Informative and Diverse Dialogue Systems over Hierarchical Crowd Intelligence Knowledge Graph](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3583758) \\
**Hao Wang**, Bin Guo, Jiaqi Liu, Yasan Ding, Zhiwen Yu

- Knowledge-enhanced dialogue systems aim to generate factually correct and coherent responses by reasoning over knowledge sources, which is a promising research trend. we present CrowdDialog, a crowd intelligence knowledge-enhanced dialogue system, which takes advantage of ‚Äúcrowd intelligence knowledge‚Äù extracted from social media (with rich subjective descriptions and diversified expression styles) to promote the performance of dialogue systems.
